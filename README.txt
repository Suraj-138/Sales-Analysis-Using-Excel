Steps followed:

1. The raw data was converted to a table for seamlessly handling future data.
2. To understand our data better, some statistical metrics were calculated like average, mean, count, minimum, maximum etc.
3. Furthermore, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) was performed to know if there are any duplicate data, and to analyze amounts greater than or less
   than the average etc.
4. Anamoly detection was performed to detect outliers. These are important and should be considered.
